# Notes

`getAll` - The getAll method in searchParams is a method that allows you to retrieve all the values associated with a specific key in a search query string. It returns an array of strings containing the values associated with the specified key. For example, if you have a search query string "?name=john&age=30", you can use the getAll method to retrieve the values for "name" and "age" by calling searchParams.getAll("name") and searchParams.getAll("age"). The getAll method is useful when you have multiple values for a single key in the search query string.
